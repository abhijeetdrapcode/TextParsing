6. Intellectual Property Rights

6.1  
All Intellectual Property Rights belonging to a party, subcontractor, or third party prior to the Effective Date, or created independently and not in relation to this Agreement or otherwise than in the provision of the Deliverables and/or the Services (“Pre-Existing IPR”) will remain vested in that party, subcontractor, or third party (as applicable) and shall not be transferred hereunder.

6.2  
Subject to clause 6.1 and except in cases where the Contractor is in material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement, all fees due and payable under this Agreement having been received by the Contractor in full and cleared funds, all newly developed Intellectual Property Rights in any aspect of the Deliverables (including any custom components developed specifically for the Client) shall belong to and vest in the Client upon creation. The Contractor hereby assigns and will procure that its subcontractors assign to the Client or as the Client directs with full title guarantee (by way of present assignment of future rights) all its Intellectual Property Rights therein. The Contractor shall ensure that its employees, contractors, consultants, and subcontractors waive all moral rights they might have in the Deliverables.

6.3  
The Contractor grants the Client and any entity to whom this Agreement (or any part thereof) is assigned, novated, or otherwise transferred, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, paid-up license to use, execute, display, install, test, reproduce, distribute, sub-license (temporarily to third-party service providers only in accordance with clause 6.4), modify, maintain, enhance, commercially exploit, and create derivative works of its Pre-Existing IPR (subject at all times to the terms of any third-party or open source licensing terms pursuant to clauses 6.8 and 6.9):

(a) contained in the Deliverables; or  
(b) otherwise delivered to the Client by the Contractor, or required to use, maintain, or develop the Deliverables (or any part thereof),

and to permit such use of such Pre-Existing IPR by the Client (and its directors, officers, employees, contractors, and suppliers) and each entity to whom this Agreement (or any part thereof) is assigned, novated, or otherwise transferred solely to the extent necessary for its general business purposes in relation to the Deliverables and the Services.

6.4  
The Contractor agrees that the Client has the limited and non-exclusive right to sub-license to third-party service providers of the Client (both existing and future) the Pre-Existing IPR described in clause 6.3 in similar terms to the license described in clause 6.3 (save for the right for such third-party suppliers to further sub-license) for the purposes of providing services to the Client and/or each entity to whom this Agreement (or any part thereof) is assigned, novated, or otherwise transferred.

6.5  
For clarity, the license granted in clause 6.3 and any licenses granted under clause 6.4 shall continue to apply notwithstanding the extension, expiration, or termination of this Agreement, except where the assignment in clause 6.2 has not occurred due to a failure of the Client to pay all the fees lawfully due to the Contractor.

6.6  
Except as expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement, neither party shall acquire any right, title, or interest in any Intellectual Property Rights belonging to the other party, or the other party’s licensors.

Escrow

6.7  
Upon the Client’s written request, the Contractor shall deliver the executable version of the Deliverables and/or software to the Client upon delivery of the Deliverables. The Contractor shall provide the source code and object code version of such Deliverables in appropriate computer-readable form and all updates thereto, together with all updated manuals, documentation, and information that are reasonably necessary for maintenance, modification, or enhancement of such Deliverables, and the Pre-Existing IPR required to use such source code and object code in accordance with the Scope of Work (SOW), to the Client:

(a) on delivery of the executable version of the Deliverables; and  
(b) at the intervals set out in the applicable SOW.

Where the Deliverables or any component thereof uses Open Source Software in whole or in part, such Open Source Software shall be licensed according to the terms and conditions of the specific license under which the relevant Open Source Software is distributed. It is provided "as is," and without limitation, the Contractor specifically denies any implied or express representation that such Open Source Software in conjunction with or as incorporated or linked with the Deliverables will be fit:

(a) to operate in conjunction with any hardware items or software products other than those identified as being compatible with the Deliverables; or  
(b) to operate uninterrupted or error-free.

Third Party Software

6.9  
Where the Contractor uses Third Party Software in the provision of the Deliverables, such Third Party Software shall be licensed subject to the relevant third-party licensing terms. The Client acknowledges that the only warranties in relation to the Third Party Software, or the supply thereof, are those contained in the standard license terms from the third-party suppliers. To the extent that any warranties are given to the Contractor, it will pass on the benefit of such warranties to the Client. The Client agrees to be bound to the relevant third parties by such license terms and to use reasonable endeavors to ensure that its Affiliates are similarly bound. Third Party Software is provided "as is," and without limitation, the Contractor specifically denies any implied or express representation that such Third Party Software in conjunction with or as incorporated or linked with the Deliverables will be fit:

(a) to operate in conjunction with any hardware items or software products other than those identified as being compatible with the Deliverables; or  
(b) to operate uninterrupted or error-free.

(f) not sub-contract to any third party any of the Contractor's obligations to process that Personal Data on behalf of the Client without the Client’s prior written consent; and  
(g) not process, or cause to be processed, that Personal Data outside the European Economic Area unless the Contractor has:

(ii) fulfilled all of the Client’s requirements to enable the processing to take place outside the European Economic Area.
