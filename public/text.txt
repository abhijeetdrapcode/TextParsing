16.4
If the Developer is excused from the performance of the Services pursuant to a Force Majeure Event then, at the Client’s option and without limiting any other rights it may have, the Client may take control of the part of the Services affected by the Force Majeure Event and in so doing may perform any act that the Client deems reasonably necessary in order to restore the Services. The Client shall not be charged for Services that are not provided to the Client as a result of a Force Majeure Event.

16.5
Upon the cessation of the Force Majeure Event the Affected Party must promptly notify the other Party of such cessation and resume performance of the affected obligations.

16.6
Subject to clause 16.4, if, as a result of a Force Majeure Event, the performance by the Affected Party of some but not all of its obligations under this Agreement are affected, the Affected Party nevertheless remains liable for the performance of those obligations not affected by the Force Majeure Event.
